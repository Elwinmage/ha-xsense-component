# ha-xsense-component_test

## Overview
This integration for Home Assistant allows the use of X-Sense devices within a smart home system. It was created based on the original code by [Theo Snel](https://github.com/theosnel/homeassistant-core/tree/xsense/homeassistant/components/xsense) and is published with his permission and collaboration.

Until an official Home Assistant integration from Theo becomes available, this HACS integration will be used and regularly updated to add new functionalities and resolve existing issues. This integration allows users to easily integrate their X-Sense devices into Home Assistant and use them for various automations and monitoring.

## Features
- Integration of various X-Sense devices into Home Assistant.
- Support for automations based on X-Sense sensor data.
- Support for the following device types: base stations, smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, heat alarms, water leak detectors, and hygrometers.
- Easy setup through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store).

## Requirements
- A functional Home Assistant server (latest version recommended).
- An X-Sense account with supported devices.
- HACS must be installed in Home Assistant to enable integration installation.

## How-to Video
For a detailed guide on installation and configuration of the integration, you can watch the following video:

## Preparation
Before installing the integration, some preparations are necessary:

- **Create a second account in the X-Sense app (for use with Home Assistant)**: Since it is not possible to be logged into the app and Home Assistant with the same account simultaneously, we recommend using a separate account for Home Assistant. This prevents you from constantly being logged out of either the app or Home Assistant. The additional account allows for seamless integration and usage without disruptions caused by repeated logins.

- **Share the supported devices from the main account with the Home Assistant account**: Use the X-Sense app to share **only the supported devices** with the newly created account. This way, the integration can be used easily in Home Assistant while administration continues through the main account.

## Supported Devices
This integration supports a variety of X-Sense devices. Here is a list of the currently confirmed and tested devices:
- **Base station (SBS50)**: Central hub for X-Sense devices.
- **Heat alarm (XH02-M)**: Detects unusually high temperatures.
- **Carbon monoxide detector (XC01-M; XC04-WX)**: Detects dangerous concentrations of carbon monoxide.
- **Smoke detector (XS01-M, WX; XS03-WX; XS0B-MR)**: Early detection of smoke.
- **Carbon monoxide and smoke combination detector (SC07-WX; XP0A-MR (partially supported))**: Combined devices for detecting carbon monoxide and smoke.
- **Water leak detector (SWS51)**: Detects the presence of water in unwanted areas.
- **Hygrometer-thermometer (STH51)**: Monitors temperature and humidity.

These devices can be used to create automations and alerts after being integrated into Home Assistant.

## Automation Examples
With this integration, various automations can be created. Here are some examples:

### Example 1: Temperature Alert
When the temperature from an X-Sense thermometer is too high, a notification is sent:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Xsense Temperature Alert"
    trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.xsense_temperature
      above: 30
    action:
      service: notify.notify
      data:
        message: "The temperature exceeds 30 degrees!"
```

### Example 2: Water Leak Alarm
When the water leak detector detects water, an alert is triggered:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Water Leak Alarm"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.xsense_waterleak
      to: "on"
    action:
      service: notify.notify
      data:
        message: "Water leak detected!"
```
